#  ClassicalPlayer
iOS music player intended for classical music.
Most classical music isn't just "songs," but consists of pieces comprising multiple movements. Access your iTunes library by composer and piece/work.

Basic idea: the app reads the iTunes library on the device, infers pieces from the names on the "songs" on an album, and then presents the library by composer, piece, and movement.

The inference of pieces from "song" names follows a few simple rules. (It isn't foolproof!)
